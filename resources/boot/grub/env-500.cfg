### OPTIONAL

# Enable bootverbose flag
# =======================
# This flags is set whenever `boothowto` has the flag 0x800 enabled.
# Since `boothowto` is hardcoded inside `hammer_time`, we patch the
# corresponding `mov` instruction.
write_dword 0x243341E 0x800 0x800

### HACKS

# Disable `sflash_hrt_usleep`
# ==========================
# This prevents the kernel from waiting for an event that never occurs,
# presumably caused by a missing feature in the implementation of the sflash interface
# inside Aeolia's PCIe glue device (missing/wrong interrupt fired).
write_byte 0x2579620 0xC3

# Fix `aeolia_emctimer_read`
# =========================
# The kernel performs multiple reads on the Aeolia EMC timer (clocked at 32.768 KHz),
# until two consecutive reads yield the same timestamp. Unfortunately, while doing
# virtualization, the 30-microsecond window is to small for this to happen, so we
# patch the checks away.
# One explanation for the need of making identical consecutive reads in the drivers,
# is that the underlying timer is connected via an 8-bit bus, so reads in real consoles
# might yield partially updated values.
